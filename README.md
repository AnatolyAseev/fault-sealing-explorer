# fault-sealing-explorer
A short code which simulates >8000 HC column heights of faulted HC accumulations using widely-used Sperrevik's (2002) and Yielding's (2010) set of equations.
The purpose is to show that blind use of these approaches in exploration is too risky and carry too many uncertainties.
